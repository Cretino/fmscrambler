## What is this?
This is a simple tool for the Playstation One (PSX) game called "Yu-Gi-Oh! Forbidden Memories" that has some randomization functions to make the game fun, specifically (but not limited to) when racing with other people via SpeedRunsLive.

It is still a **work in progress** and getting new functionalities added. As of right now the following features are useable:
- Automatic game data extraction (from .BIN/.CUE)
- Automatic game image patching
- Randomizing Card Attributes
- Randomizing Card Guardian Stars (also allowing glitched Guardian Stars)
- Randomizing Attack and Defense values of Cards
- Randomizing Card Types
- Randomizing Card Drops
- Randomizing Duelist Decks
- Randomizing Equip Cards
- Randomizing Fusions
- "000" Glitch Fusion Cards

The following features are planned for future releases:
- "Expert" Settings (for people who know what they are doing and are fine with possible game crashes)
- In-Game Dialogue Randomization (+ Weird Google Translation mode)
- Card Name and Description Text Randomization (+ Weird Google Translation mode)
- Remove all In-Game Dialogue
- Displaying "fmscrambler" logo and the used seed on the Title Screen
- UI enhancements
- Starter Deck Randomization
- Audio and Music Randomizer

I'm always happy to see people enjoying the stuff I made, gives me motivation to work on things like this.

On rare occasions I also stream random stuff on Twitch. Maybe in the future I'll show some coding for the Scrambler there or other future projects I have in mind!
