# YGO! FM Scrambler (fmscrambler)
Version 0.1.7 Alpha out now!

### What is this?
This is a simple tool for the Playstation One (PSX) game called "Yu-Gi-Oh! Forbidden Memories" that has some randomization functions to make the game fun, specifically (but not limited to) when racing with other people via SpeedRunsLive.

### Enjoying the tool? Like to support me?
I'm always happy to see people enjoying the stuff I made, gives me motivation to work on things like this.
Feel free to recommend the tool to your friends, play it, contribute here, stream it over on Twitch and so on.

If you wish to donate something to me, you can do so using the donation page: [https://ko-fi.com/dukefm](https://ko-fi.com/dukefm)

On rare occasions I also stream random stuff on Twitch. Maybe in the future I'll show some coding for the Scrambler there or other future projects I have in mind!
